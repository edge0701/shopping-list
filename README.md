The aim of project is to create a shopping list application.
The requirements are as follows:

- [X] View a list of items on a shopping list

- [X] Remove items from the shopping list
- [X] Ability to cross purchased items off the list

- [ ] Use an API to fetch prices on the list
- [ ] Display the total cost of the items
- [ ] Set a spending limit and alert if exceeded
